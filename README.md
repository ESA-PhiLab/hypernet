# HYPERNET

HYPERNET is a library which implements state-of-the-art and new algorithms for (among others):

* accurate hyperspectral image (HSI) segmentation and analysis using deep neural networks,
* optimization of deep neural network architectures for hyperspectral data segmentation,
* hyperspectral data augmentation,
* validation of existent and emerging HSI segmentation algorithms,
* simulation of multispectral data using HSI.
